## Conditions

Overall, we're going to give you 6 homeworks and 2 exams

Each of the homeworks is going to have regular problems
giving you 10 points if you manage to do them well.
On top of that every homework is going to have 5 bonus
points making it up to 15 points you could get out of
each.

Sending your homework after the deadline is going to
automatically affect the points you can get from it:
typically reduce them to half, unless you have a serious
excuse.

The deadline is going to always be appended to the name of 
the homework.
Example: `homework0-25102015`

The deadline always marks the last day until midnight. So
it means you can still send your homework during the day,
in this case during `25.10.2015`

Each of the exams is going to have regular problems
giving you 15 points if you manage to do them well.
On top of that every exam is going to have 10 bonus
points making it up to 25 points you could get out of
each.

The maximum points you can get is 130 and the grades are
distributed as follows:
- [100, 140) : 6
-  [80, 100) : 5
-  [60, 80)  : 4 
-  [40, 60)  : 3

For every two unsent homeworks (exluding homework0) we are
going to lower the grade by 1. So, it's very important to
send your homework, it doesn't have to be perfect but at
least put the effort to participate.

If you don't come to one of the exam your final grade will
be lowered by 1 but **if you don't come to both of the exams
the best you could get is 3**.

So, if you just participate and send your homework and do 
the exams, you'll probably won't have a problem to get a
very good to excellent mark.

We are free to give bonus points outside the formulated
system explained above if we think someone overdid in a
reasonable way, if we like a particular solution or even 
if someone managed to follow strictly given instructions.
