#### Problem 0

Write a program which takes two integer arrays with maximum size of 100, sorts them  and then makes a sorted array from the values of both initial arrays and prints it.

Step 1: Make three functions. One for entering the values of an one-dimensional integer array from the keyboard. One for sorting an array.
And one for printing it to the console.

Step 2: Make a function which takes two sorted arrays and merges them in to a new sorted one, without sorting again.

You can use the bubblesort sorting algorithm. All the sorting should happen in ascending order! 

###### Examples

```c++
$ [1, 5, 3, -50] [4, 3, 11, 160, -1, 2]
[-50, -1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 11, 160 ]

$ [1, 15, 2] [3, -2]
[-2, 1, 2, 3, 15]
```

#### Problem 1

Write a program which takes an integer array with maximum size of 100 and finds and prints the most repeated number in it.
If there are more than one with the same number of occurences, print the bigger.

###### Examples

```c++
$ [1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 3, 6]
5

$ [10, 33, 44, 33, -10, 8, 10, 45, 10]
10

```

#### Problem 2

Write a program that takes as input a two-dimensional array(matrix) with maximum size 100x100 and prints the elements on its main diagonal.

###### Examples

```

$ [4x4 matrix](https://gyazo.com/294aeae233831d015f4dc80ea524976e)
2, 123, 222, 7

$ [5x5 matrix](https://gyazo.com/5b67654e000d308b2bc2d9aa4dabe11f)
43, -12, 303, 213, 23
```
