#### Problem 0
##### Description:
Write a program that for a given `x` computes the expression:
```
mult = (...(((x + 2) * x + 3) * x + 4) * x + ... + 10) * x + 11
```
**Input:** `int x`

**Output:** `mult (int)`

---

#### Problem 1
##### Description:

Write a program that for a given `x` and `n >= 1` computes 
```
sum = sinx + (sinx)^2 + (sinx)^3 + ... + (sinx)^n
```
**Input:** `double x, int n >= 1`

**Output:** `sum (double)`

---

#### Problem 2
##### Description:

Write a program that for a given `n >= 1` computes 
```
f = (2n)!! = 2 * 4 * 6 * ... * 2n
```
**Input:** `int n >= 1`

**Output:** `f (int)`

---

#### Problem 3
##### Description:

Write a program that for a given `n >= 1` finds the sum of every 3rd integer in
the range (1, n)
```
sum = 2 + 5 + 8 + ...
```
**Input:** `int n >= 1`

**Output:** `sum (int)`

---

#### Problem 4
##### Description:

Same as Problem 3 but if you implemented it with `for`, now use `while` and vice
versa

---

#### Problem 5
##### Description:

We'll look at the problems from the homework and do a few similar ones if we
have time left.
