#### Problem 0
##### Description

Write a program which takes a positive integer "n" and then prints all the prime numbers in the range (1,n)

###### Examples

```c++
$ 10
2, 3, 5, 7

$ 30
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
```

#### Problem 1
##### Description

Write a program which takes a positive integer "n" and prints the average of its prime divisors ('1' is not a prime)
*The first one to solve this gets a bonus point* (He should already have solved problem 0)

###### Examples

```c++
$ 28 
6 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
Prime divisors: 2, 7
Result: 4.5

$ 12 
2.5

$ 273 
7.66666666667
```

---


#### Problem 2
##### Description

Modify the previous program to find the average of the divisors which are prime OR with even sum of digits

###### Examples

```c++
$ 28 
6 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
Prime divisors: 2, 7
Divisors with even sum of digits: 2, 4, 28
Result: (2+4+7+28)/4 = 10.25

$ 12 
4

$ 273 
71
```

#### Problem 3
##### Description

Write a program that takes an array of integers (entered from the console with maximum size of 100) and finds the smallest and the largest element.

###### Examples

```c++
$ [10, 2, 3, 5, 15 , 4]
2, 15

$ [1, 2, 20, 3, 4, -4, 10, -5, 8, 9, 11, -1]
-5, 20
```
