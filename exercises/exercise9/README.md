#### Problem 0

Write a *recursive* function which finds the greatest common divisor of two integer numbers

###### Example
```c++
$ 12 40
4
$ 15 80
5
```
---

#### Problem 1

Write a *recursive* function which compares two string(char arrays) lexicographically and returns:
-> If the first is ">" 1
-> If they are equal 0
-> If the second is ">" -1

###### Example

$ ['a', 'b', 'd'] ['d' 'c']
1
$ ['a', 'e', 'g'] ['a', 'e', 'g']
0
$ ['f', 'q' 'z'] ['z', 'd' 'q']
-1
---

#### Problem 2

Implement *Quick Sort* through a recursive function which takes as arguments an array with integers and two indexes(initially - first and last of the array)

###### Examples

```c++
$ [-100, 5, 10, 2, 333, 23, 25, 9 , 8]
[333, 25, 23, 10, 9, 8, 5, 2, -100]
```
---

#### Problem 3

Implement *Merge Sort* through a recursive function which takes as arguments an array with integers and two indexes(initially - first and last of the array)

###### Example

```c++
$ Input: [-10, 20, 10, -200, 23, 7, 13]
[-200, -10, 7, 10, 13, 20, 23]
```
