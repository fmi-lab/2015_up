#### Problem 1

Write a function which takes a matrix(NxM) filled with ones and zeros and returns the number of 2x2 squares with only ones or only zeros

###### Example

$ Input: [Matrix 5x4](https://gyazo.com/92743b90b92d90e32f95688de3d14f88)

Return value: 4

#### Problem 2

Write a function which takes two pointers and sorts all the integers between them with the insertion sorting algorithm(descending order). Between the pointers there should be only numbers. After the sorting print the array.

###### Examples

```c++
$ -100, 5, 10, 2, 1050, 23, 25, 9 , 8
1050, 25, 23, 10, 9, 8, 5, 2, -100
```
---

#### Problem 3

Write a recursive function which finds and returns the factorial of a given number n

###### Examples

```c++
$ 5
120

$ 4
24

$ 6
720
```

---

#### Problem 4

Write a recursive function which finds and returns the nth fibonacci number for a given n.

###### Examples

```c++
$ 5
5

$ 7
13

$ 10
55
```

---

#### Problem 5

Write a recursive function which finds and returns the sum of all the even numbers in a given range [a,b].

###### Examples

```c++
$ 1 10
30

$ 20 25
66
```
