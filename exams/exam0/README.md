#### Problem 0
##### Points: 3

Write a program which takes as input coordinates (x,y) and checks if the point with these coordinates belongs
to [this figure](https://gyazo.com/dee8c06f86bac440d606b55e4ca1457d). In case it does, print the boolean true. In any other -> false

###### Examples

```c++
$ (1, -3)
true

$ (1.5, 1)
false

$ (-0.8, -0.5)
true
```
