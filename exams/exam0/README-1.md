#### Problem 0
##### Points: 3

Write a program which takes as input coordinates (x,y) and checks if the point with these coordinates belongs
to [this figure](https://gyazo.com/dee8c06f86bac440d606b55e4ca1457d). In case it does, print the boolean true. In any other -> false

###### Examples

```c++
$ (1, -3)
true

$ (1.5, 1)
false

$ (-0.8, -0.5)
true
```

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 3

Write a program which takes as input numbers while the user enters four descending ones in a roll. When it stops print the four descending numbers.

###### Examples

```c++
$ 1, 2, -1, 0, 4, 1, 0, -2
4, 1, 0, -2

$ 10, 20, 20, 10, 5
20, 20, 10, 5

$ 5, 4, -1, -2, -3, -100
-1, -2, -3, -100
```

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 4

Write a program which takes as input a positive integer n and prints all of its divisors which are with even sum of digits

###### Examples
```c++
$ 12
2, 4, 6

$ 30
2, 6, 15

$ 25

```

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 5

Write a program which takes a positive integer n and prints the number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in it.

###### Examples

```c++
$ 12220448
0 - 1 time
1 - 1 time
2 - 3 times
3 - 0 times
4 - 2 times
5 - 0 times
6 - 0 times
7 - 0 times
8 - 1 time
9 - 0 times

$ 899 
0 - 0 times
1 - 0 times
...
7 - 0 times
8 - 1 time
9 - 2 times

$ 1000001
0 - 5 times
1 - 2 times
2 - 0 times
...
9 - 0 times
```
**Hint:** Use array

#### Problem 4 [BONUS]
##### Points: 5

Write a program that takes n (positive) as argument and computes Ï€ (pi) using the first n members of the Gregory series: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GregorySeries.html

---

#### Problem 5 [BONUS]
##### Points: 5

Every positive integer multiple of 2, 3 and 5 is called Hamming number (a.k.a. Regular number): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number

Write a program that finds the first `n` Hamming numbers, for a given `n`.
