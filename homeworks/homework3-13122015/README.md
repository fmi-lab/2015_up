#### Problem 0
##### Points: 1

Write a program that finds the product of the given polynomials P<sub>n</sub>(x) and Q<sub>m</sub>(x).

##### Hint

Use arrays with size `n` and `m` for the coeficients of the polynomials and an array with size `n+m` for the product.

---

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 2

Write a program that finds the product of the even non-zero numbers over the main diagonal for a given square matrix of integers A<sub>nxn</sub> (1 <= n <= 10).

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 2

Write a program that deletes the k-th row (1 <= k <= n) of a given rectangular matrix of real numbers A<sub>nxm</sub> (1 <= n <= 10, 1 <= m <= 20).

---

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 2

Write a program that finds the sum of the matrices A<sub>nxm</sub> and B<sub>nxm</sub> (1 <= n <= 20, 1 <= m <= 30).

---

#### Problem 4
##### Points: 3

Write a program that traverses diagonally, parallel to and under the main diagonal downwards, a square matrix of integers and puts copies elements in an one-dimensional array.

---

#### Problem 5 [BONUS]
##### Points: 1.5

Write a program that sorts in ascending order the elements of each row of a square table of strings (words with max length 9).

---

#### Problem 6 [BONUS]
##### Points: 3.5

For given two arrays of strings -- `students` and `grades` with 20 strings at most for each of them. 

The strings in the `students` array are presented as `XXXXXX YYYY...` where `XXXXXX` is a 6-digit faculty number and `YYYY...` is name with undetermined length.

The strings in the `grades` array are presented as `XXXXXX YYYY` where `XXXXXX` is  a 6-digit faculty number and `YYYY` is a real-number grade.

Both of the arrays are sorted in ascending order by faculty number. It is possible that in one of the arrays there's data for faculty numbers which are not present in the other array. In both of the arrays a faculty number is unique (meaning that there aren't more than one same faculty numbers).

Write a prgram that prints the names and grades of those students that a data is present in both of the arrays and their grades are increased by one but the max grade is still 6.00.
