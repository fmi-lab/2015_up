# Homeworks

## Instructions

-   Write each problem in a separate **.cpp** file called:

    ```
    problem<number_of_problem_as_it_is_in_README>.cpp
    ```

-   Archive all the problems to a **.zip** called:

    ```
    hw<number_of_homework>_<your_faculty_number>_<your_name>.zip
    ```

-   Upload the **.zip** to a pCloud repository (each homework is going to have a different upload link)

### Notice

If a particular problem involves substituting parts of other problems then you
should just copy the problems that you need to change in a folder called
`problem<number_of_problem>` and then edit the files. That way, you'll have your
original files and the edited ones.

Otherwise, as much as we don't want to, we have to give you points only for one
of the problems.
