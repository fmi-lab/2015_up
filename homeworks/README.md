# Homeworks

### Note

If a particular problem involves substituting parts of other problems then you
should just copy the problems that you need to change in a folder called
`problem<number_of_problem>` and then edit the files. That way, you'll have your
original files and the edited ones.

Otherwise, as much as we don't want to, we have to give you points only for one
of the problems.

#### Example

In [Homework0](https://github.com/fmi-lab/up/tree/master/homeworks/hw0#bonus-problem-5-25-points)
there's a bonus problem that requires me to substitute `for` with `while`, it is
problem5.

So, I create a folder called `problem5` and copy, for example `problem4.cpp` in
it.

Then I edit `problem5/problem4.cpp` and my orginal solution is untouched. But
if you edit `problem4.cpp` rightaway we can't give you points for your 
implementation using `for`.

### Instructions

-   Write each problem in a separate **.cpp** file called:

    ```
    problem<number_of_problem_as_it_is_in_README>.cpp
    ```

-   Archive all the problems to a **.zip** called:

    ```
    <your_faculty_number>_<your_name>_hw<number_of_homework>.zip
    ```

-   Attach the archive to an email with subject

    ```
    [Homework<number_of_homework>] <faculty_number> <name>
    ```

    to

    ```
    ip_assistants_2015+cs_5g@fmi.uni-sofia.bg
    ```

#### Example

I managed to do problems from 0 to 5, so I should have:
```
problem0.cpp
problem1.cpp
problem2.cpp
problem3.cpp
problem4.cpp
problem5
    problem3.cpp
    problem4.cpp
```

I'll archive them in a **.zip** and call the archive
`81202_monika-eftimova_hw0.zip`

Then I'll attach the archive to a new email with subject:
`[Homework0] 81202 Monika Eftimova` and send it to 
`ip_assistants_2015+cs_5g@fmi.uni-sofia.bg`
