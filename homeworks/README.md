# Homeworks

## Note

If a particular problem involves substituting parts of other problems then you
should just copy the problems that you need to change in a folder called
`problem<number_of_problem>` and then edit the files. That way, you'll have your
original files and the edited ones.

Otherwise, as much as we don't want to, we have to give you points only for one
of the problems.

### Example

In [Homework0](https://github.com/fmi-lab/up/tree/master/homeworks/hw0#bonus-problem-5-25-points)
there's a bonus problem that requires me to substitute `for` with `while`, it is
`problem5`.

So, I create a folder called `problem5` and copy, for example `problem4.cpp` in
it.

Then I edit `problem5/problem4.cpp` and my orginal solution is untouched. But
if you edit `problem4.cpp` rightaway we can't give you points for your 
implementation using `for`.

## Instructions

-   Write each problem in a separate **.cpp** file called:

    ```
    problem<number_of_problem_as_it_is_in_README>.cpp
    ```

-   Archive all the problems to a **.zip** called:

    ```
    hw<number_of_homework>_<your_faculty_number>_<your_name>.zip
    ```

-   Attach the archive to an email with subject

    ```
    [Homework<number_of_homework>] <faculty_number> <name>
    ```

    and send it to

    ```
    ip_assistants_2015+cs_5g@fmi.uni-sofia.bg
    ```

### Example

From [Homework0](https://github.com/fmi-lab/up/tree/master/homeworks/hw0#bonus-problem-5-25-points)
I managed to do problems from 0 to 5, so I should have:

```
problem0.cpp
problem1.cpp
problem2.cpp
problem3.cpp
problem4.cpp
problem5
    problem3.cpp
    problem4.cpp
```

I'll archive them in a **.zip** and call the archive
`hw0_81202_monika-eftimova.zip`

Then I'll attach the archive to a new email with subject:
`[Homework0] 81202 Monika Eftimova` and send it to 
`ip_assistants_2015+cs_5g@fmi.uni-sofia.bg`


## Grading

Overall, we're going to give you 6 homeworks, each of them will have regular
problems giving you 10 points if you manage to do them but each homework is
going to have also 5 bonus points.

You need 60 points for excellent mark but you can obtain 90 points. So, chances
are good that you'll manage to do well.

Handling your homework after the deadline will automatically reduce the points 
you can get from it to half.

The deadline is going to always be appended to the name of the homework.
Example: `homework0-25102015`
