### Wherever possible define and use functions don't just do everything in the main().

---

#### Problem 0
##### Points: 1

Write a function that inserts a symbol in a sorted in ascending order array of chars. The result should also be a sorted array of chars.

---

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 2

Write function that checks if a string represents a correct real number.

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 2

N triangles are given by their sides (1 <= n <= 20). Write a program that determines which triangle has the largest area and prints it.

---

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 2

Write a program that fills a matrix A nxm by rows changing the direction alternatively.

##### Example

n = 4, m = 5

If you want to fill the matrix with the numbers from 1 to 20, then the matrix should look like as follows:

```
 1  2  3  4  5
10  9  8  7  6
11 12 13 14 15
20 19 18 17 16
```

---

#### Problem 4
##### Points: 3

Write a program that sorts the even rows of a matrix in an ascending order and the odd rows in a descending order.

---

### Use recursion.

---

#### Problem 5
##### Points: 1

Given n (n >= 1), define a recursive function that finds the product of the integers from 1 to n with step 3 (1.4.7.10. ...)

---

#### Problem 6 
##### Points: 2

Define a recursive function that prints out the prime divisors of a given positive integer.

---

#### Problem 7 
##### Points: 2

Define a recursive function that determines whether a given positive integer is a member of the Fibonacci sequence.

---

#### Problem 8
##### Points: 2

Define a recursive function that checks if a given integer is a member of an array.

---

#### Problem 9
##### Points: 3

Define a recursive function that transforms a positive integer in it's string equivalent (123 -> "123"). The function should return the length of the string.

---

#### Problem 10 [BONUS]
##### Points: 5 

A system of linear equations of n-th order is given. Write a program that solves it in case it's defined.

---

#### Problem 11 [BONUS]
##### Points: 2 

Define a recursive function that prints the pyramid:

```
n
n n-1
n n-1 n-2
...
n n-1 n-2 ... 1
```

---

#### Problem 12 [BONUS]
##### Points: 3

Define a recursive function that sorts in ascending order an array of symbols.
