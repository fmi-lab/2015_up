# Homework with deadline 25/10/2015 including Sunday
Write every problem in a different *.cpp file and send them in an archive with a name = Your name + Faculty number

## Problem 0(2 points)

**Input:** coordinates of a point (x, y)

**Output:** True/False; if the point belongs to ### [this figure](https://i.gyazo.com/cfb7ca1c9e1f72e4acfebc99c4160b27.png)

## Problem 1(1 point)

**Input:** n(n is a **three-digit positive number**)

**Output:** The number formed by reversing the digits of n(Not just printing the digits in reversed order)

## Problem 2(2 points)

**Input:** n(n is a **two-digit positive number**)

**Output:** The name of the number written with symbols(Don't write tons of if statements)

## Problem 3(2 points)

**Input:** n(n>0) and k(k>0)

**Output:** n raised to the power of k(n^k). Dont use the function pow()

## Problem 4(3 points)

**Input:** n(n>0)

**Output:** The nth Fibonacci number ([Fibonacci numbers](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B8))

## Problem 5 (**Bonus** for 2.5 points)
If you used for-cycles in some of the problems above, now write them all with [while](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_while_loop.htm) (and vice versa .. if you used while -> now use for)

## Problem 6 (**Bonus** for 2.5 points)
In the above problems whenever there is a condition for the input use [do-while](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_do_while_loop.htm) to check everytime you "cin", if the condition is fulfilled. 
For example, if you want to check whether the integer n is positive you write:
int n;
do{
 std::cin>>n;
}while(n<=0);
