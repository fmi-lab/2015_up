#### Problem 0
##### Points: 1 

Write a program that finds the reciprocal number of the product of these elements from the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 10) for which the following relation is true:

2 < a<sub>i</sub> < i!

---

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 1

Write a program, for a given number `x`, which finds whether a number equal to `x` is in the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 100) 

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 2

Write a program that checks if exists a period in an one-dimensional array of integers. For example: if the elements of the array are `1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1`, the period is 3. If a period exists print it out.

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 3

Write a program that finds the position of some symbol `c` in a sorted in ascending order array of symbols.

Try using the `divide and conquer` algorithm for binary search. Reference: http://algorithms.openmymind.net/search/binarysearch.html

#### Problem 4
##### Points: 3

Write a program that for given sequences of a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> and b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 50) finds the number of equalities a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> (0 <= i < n).

#### Problem 5 [BONUS]
##### Points: 2.5

Write a program that takes as input n(1 < n <= 30) and then constructs a matrix(2D array) satisfying the following formula:
|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------:|
|  0  |n*(n-1)|  ...  |  ...  |   ...     |k+p+m+s+t|
|  1  |   0   |  ...  |  ...  |   ...     |   ...   |
|  2  |  k+1  |   0   |  ...  |   ...     |   ...   |
| ... |  k+2  | k+p+1 |   0   |k+p+m+s+t+1|   ...   |
| ... |  ...  |  ...  | ...   |    0      |k+p+m+s+2|
| k   |  k+p  | k+p+m |k+p+m+s|k+p+m+s+1  |    0	|
##### Examples:
Input: 5
Output: 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  0  |  20 |  19 |  17 |  14 |
|  1  |  0  |  18 |  16 |  13 |
|  2  |  5  |  0  |  15 |  12 |
|  3  |  6  |  8  |  0  |  11 |
|  4  |  7  |  9  |  10 |  0  |
