#### Problem 0
##### Points: 1 

Write a program that finds the reciprocal number of the product of these elements from the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 10) for which the following relation is true:

2 < a<sub>i</sub> < i!

---

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 1

Write a program, for a given number `x`, which finds whether a number equal to `x` is in the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 100) 

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 2

Write a program that checks if exists a period in an one-dimensional array of integers. For example: if the elements of the array are `1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1`, the period is 3. If a period exists print it out.

---

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 3

Write a program that finds the position of some symbol `c` in a sorted in ascending order array of symbols.

Try using the `divide and conquer` algorithm for binary search. Reference: http://algorithms.openmymind.net/search/binarysearch.html

---

#### Problem 4
##### Points: 3

Write a program that for given sequences of a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> and b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 50) finds the number of equalities a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> (0 <= i < n).

#### Problem 5 [BONUS]
##### Points: 2.5

Write a program that takes as input n(1 < n <= 30) and then constructs a matrix(2D array) satisfying the following [formula](https://gyazo.com/ab445dc488b95c81c684495994dc8273).

##### Examples:

Input: 5
Output: 
[Matrix 5x5](https://gyazo.com/028ead6cc4dbe388a1d679fa51786e68)

Input: 3
Output: 
[Matrix 3x3](https://gyazo.com/9a0c4c5391c540847fe5c6ca3f5507ab)


---

#### Problem 6 [BONUS]
##### Points: 2.5

Write a program that for a given matrix(n x n) prints the elements below the secondary diagonal which are fibonacci numbers(<= 500). The printing of the numbers should be in ascending order.

##### Examples:

Input: n = 3 and [Matrix nxn](https://gyazo.com/87bc3d41dabd6dd43604d2cd74a2e16d)
Output: 5, 8


Input: n = 5 and [Matrix nxn](https://gyazo.com/8a70aa9fbb3846088c29161073775359)
Output: 1, 5, 13, 34, 55
