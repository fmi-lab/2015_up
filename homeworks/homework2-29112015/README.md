#### Problem 0
##### Points: 1 

Write a program that finds the reciprocal number of the product of these elements from the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 10) for which the following relation is true:

2 < a<sub>i</sub> < i!

#### Problem 1
##### Points: 1

Write a program, for a given number `x`, which finds whether a number equal to `x` is in the sequence of integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 100) 

---

#### Problem 2
##### Points: 2

Write a program that checks if exists a period in an one-dimensional array of integers. For example: if the elements of the array are `1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1`, the period is 3. If a period exists print it out.

#### Problem 3
##### Points: 3

Write a program that finds the position of some symbol `c` in a sorted in ascending order array of symbols.

Try using the `divide and conquer` algorithm for binary search. Reference: http://algorithms.openmymind.net/search/binarysearch.html

#### Problem 4
##### Points: 3

Write a program that for given sequences of a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub> and b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>n-1</sub> (1 <= n <= 50) finds the number of equalities a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> (0 <= i < n).
